## Quick start

- Install dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install` (Yarn works just fine too).
- Make sure you have mongo service running in the background.
- In the terminal cd your way in the project's directory and run `node app.js` (or run with the debugger from bin/www).
- The app was developed and tested on a mac environment only. (Different OS have different levels of rules enforcement in the IDE).
